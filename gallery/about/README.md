## What is VuePress?

VuePress is a Vue-powered static site generator for writing documentation. To learn more about VuePress and to get started, please see the [official documentation](https://vuepress.vuejs.org).

You can now also get started with VuePress on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)! VuePress has been added as a server template and the starter project includes information about files and structure, as well as a small guide on how to get started with theme customization.
